# Highly-Available-User-Registration-System
Hi guys! This is Zhichao. The project shown below is a kind of Registration System using JAVA, Spring Frameworks, Redis, MySQL, JavaMail bar, RabbitMQ, Nginx, JavaScript(Front End). The original project is referred from https://github.com/michaelliao Java Spring Study.  NoSQL(Redis) improves service response delay. Sentinels strategies are involved here for robustness. Scalability and availability of servers are enhanced by load balancer(Nginx) and message queues(RabbitMQ). Thread pooling(ThreadExecutorSevice) and lock mechanism are used for high concurrency.
